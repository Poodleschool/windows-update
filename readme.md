This project disables your mouse cursor, and inspect element keys, all you have to do is open the webpage, press F11, and wait for them to come back to their seat in anger.

This page is so believeable due to it using Segoe UI, and Segoe Boot, which are fonts made by Microsoft for Windows' display, and loading spinner, the spinner frames are actually just a sequence of special Unicode characters, beginning from U+E052 to U+E0C8, which, when combined at one frame per .25s, you get, the original speed Windows Boot Spinner, which, means this site literally replicates the screen 1:1 with the normal screen, you would NOT be able to tell the difference until you press F11.
